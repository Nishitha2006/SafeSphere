SafeSphere — Intelligent Women Safety System

SafeSphere is an AI-assisted web-based safety platform designed to enhance personal security through real-time location tracking, intelligent risk modeling, and automated emergency response mechanisms.

It integrates modern browser APIs with AI-generated safety datasets to provide contextual risk awareness and emergency automation.

Overview

SafeSphere provides:

Real-time GPS tracking

AI-driven risk intelligence mapping

Smart SOS system with countdown protection

Voice-triggered emergency activation

Audio evidence recording

Live location sharing

Automated safety check-in

Simulation mode for testing and demonstrations

The system operates entirely on the frontend, with optional AI-based data extraction for generating safety zones.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SafeSphere.git
cd SafeSphere

Running the Application

SafeSphere loads areas.json using fetch(), which requires serving the project through a local server.

Do not open index.html directly in the browser, as CORS restrictions will prevent proper data loading.

Start a Local Server (Python)
python3 -m http.server 8000


Open in browser:

http://localhost:8000/index.html

Risk Intelligence Model

Risk scoring is dynamically calculated based on:

Proximity to identified danger zones

Crime severity weighting

Population density factors

Lighting conditions

Time-of-day multipliers

Zones are color-coded:

Risk Level	Color
Low	Green
Medium	Yellow
High	Red
Emergency Workflow
Smart SOS

User activates SOS

5-second countdown begins

If not cancelled, alarm is triggered

Incident is logged

Voice Activation

The system uses the Web Speech Recognition API to detect emergency keywords such as:

"Help"

"Emergency"

Detected keywords automatically trigger SOS.

Evidence Mode

Uses the MediaRecorder API to capture audio evidence.

Recording is stored locally

File is timestamped

No backend storage is currently implemented

Location Sharing

Generates a Google Maps link with live coordinates.

Uses:

Web Share API

Clipboard fallback

Smart Check-In

If the user fails to confirm safety before the selected timer expires, the system automatically triggers SOS.

Demo Mode

Simulates movement through predefined risk zones for:

Testing

Demonstrations

Hackathons

Presentations

AI Data Extraction Pipeline (Optional)

SafeSphere includes a Python-based pipeline for generating areas.json from safety-related articles.
